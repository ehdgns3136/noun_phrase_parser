So far, our chunk structures have been relatively flat.
Trees consist of tagged tokens, optionally grouped under a chunk node such as NP.
However, it is possible to build chunk structures of arbitrary depth, simply by creating a multi-stage chunk grammar containing recursive rules.
4.1 has patterns for noun phrases, prepositional phrases, verb phrases, and sentences.
This is a four-stage chunk grammar, and can be used to create structures having a depth of at most four.
Although we will focus on syntactic trees, trees can be used to encode any homogeneous hierarchical structure that spans a sequence of linguistic forms
